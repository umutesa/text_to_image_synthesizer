# Text to Image Synthesizer
A text-to-image synthesizer creates images based on text descriptions. It uses advanced machine learning techniques to translate linguistic input into visual output using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN).
 
## Why Use GANs?

Generative Adversarial Networks are well-suited for text-to-image synthesis because of their unique architecture, which allows them to generate highly realistic and visually coherent images. A GAN consists of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, working in competition:
1. The Generator: Creates images based on input, such as text descriptions, by learning patterns and structures from a training dataset.
2. The Discriminator: Evaluates the generated images, checking how closely they resemble real images. It provides feedback to the generator, which iteratively improves its output.
